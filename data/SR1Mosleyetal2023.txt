        "The CYP2D6 enzyme metabolizes opioids commonly prescribed for cancer-related pain, and CYP2D6 polymorphisms may contribute to variability in opioid response. We evaluated the feasibility of implementing CYP2D6-guided opioid prescribing for patients with cancer and report pilot outcome data.",
        "Methods—Adult patients from two cancer centers were prospectively enrolled into a hybrid implementation-effectiveness clinical trial and randomized to CYP2D6-genotype guided opioid selection, with clinical recommendations, or usual care. Implementation metrics, including provider response, medication changes consistent with recommendations, and patient-reported pain and symptom scores at baseline and up to 8 weeks were assessed.",
        "Results—Most (87/114, 76%) patients approached for the study agreed to participate. Of 85 patients randomized, 71% were prescribed oxycodone at baseline. The median (range) time to receive CYP2D6 test results was 10 (3–37) days; 24% of patients had physicians acknowledge genotype results in a clinic note. Among patients with CYP2D6 genotype-guided recommendations to change therapy (n=11), 18% had a change congruent with recommendations. Among patients who completed baseline and follow-up questionnaires (n=48), there was no difference in change in mean composite pain score (-1.01±2.1 vs -0.41±2.5; p=0.19) or symptom severity at last follow-up (3.96 ± 2.18 vs 3.47 ± 1.78; p=0.63) between the usual care arm (n=26) and genotype-guided arm (n=22), respectively.",
        "Conclusion—Our study revealed high acceptance of pharmacogenetic testing as part of a clinical trial among patients with cancer pain. However, provider response to genotype-guided recommendations was low, impacting assessment of pain-related outcomes. Addressing barriers to utility of pharmacogenetics results and clinical recommendations will be critical for implementation success.",
        "Cancer-related pain is a frequent and burdensome symptom associated with the disease and its treatment. Opioids are a first-line approach to alleviate moderate to severe pain for patients with cancer.1,2 Up to half of patients undergoing active cancer treatment and over 75 percent of those with advanced disease warrant opioid therapy, but individual responses vary widely leaving nearly a third of patients with inadequate pain relief.3,4,5 Although causes are multifactorial, accumulating evidence shows that pharmacogenetics (PGx) is associated with inter-individual differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic response to opioids.4,6,7 Currently, genetic factors may be responsible for 12% to 60% of variability in response to opioid therapy.5",
        "Among genetic factors, CYP2D6 genotype has the strongest evidence for influencing response to opioid analgesics. Codeine, tramadol, hydrocodone, and oxycodone undergo CYP2D6 bioactivation to metabolites (morphine, O-desmethyltramadol, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone, respectively) with higher affinity for the mu-opioid receptor than the parent compound.8,9 The CYP2D6 gene is highly polymorphic, with over 140 alleles",
        "identified,10 including instances of gene deletion or duplication.11 CYP2D6 alleles are categorized as having normal, decreased, or no function, and CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype, ranging from poor metabolizer (PM) to ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM), is determined by an individual's diplotype.12,13 In clinical context, PMs and intermediate metabolizers (IMs) have lower concentrations of the more active metabolites of CYP2D6-metabolized opioids, compared to normal metabolizers (NMs), and may fail to derive sufficient pain relief from these drugs; the data are strongest for codeine and tramadol.14,15 UMs have increased enzymatic activity and may be at increased risk for life-threatening toxicity with opioids metabolized by CYP2D6 secondary to higher concentrations of more potent metabolites.16,17",
        "The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) recommends avoiding codeine and tramadol for CYP2D6 PMs or UMs, and to consider non-opioids or opioids less influenced by CYP2D6 to reduce the risk for ineffective pain relief or toxicity, respectively.13 Similarly, alternative treatment is recommended for IMs who derive insufficient pain relief from codeine or tramadol.13 Data are more limited for hydrocodone, but recent studies suggest CYP2D6 phenotype may be important for its analgesic response.15,18",
        "Accumulating data support CYP2D6-guided opioid prescribing, but its utility in clinical practice, including use in managing cancer-related pain, is limited.15 Therefore, we aimed to examine the feasibility of implementing clinical CYP2D6 genotyping to guide pain management in cancer patients and gather pilot data on the effectiveness of this approach. We also summarize key lessons learned with this implementation."

            "The study design was approved by the University of Florida (UF) and Moffitt Cancer Center Institutional Review Boards as described previously.19,20 Briefly, this hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial tested the feasibility of implementing of CYP2D6-guided pain management while obtaining pilot data on the implementation's impact on pain-related outcomes.21 Adult cancer patients with suboptimal pain control (pain score ≥4)22 were referred for trial enrollment by their oncologist at UF Health Cancer Center or by a Moffitt Supportive Care Medicine (SCM) clinician in consultation with the patient's primary oncologist. After obtaining informed consent, a buccal brush sample was collected from each patient for genotyping, and patients were randomized to the CYP2D6-guided or usual care arm. Each site developed and managed their own randomization. Moffitt used a website research randomizer (https://www.randomizer.org/) and randomized 120 ‘sets,' and UF used a similar website (http://www.randomization.com to randomize 100 subjects into 2 groups (genotype or control) using blocks of 10 (seed 12381). Patients, providers, and researchers were not blinded to randomization groups.",
            "Samples from patients in the genotype-guided arm at each site were sent to the UF Health Pathology Laboratory for CYP2D6 genotyping using the Luminex® 100/200™ System using xTAG® CYP2D6 Kit v3 Assay, validated according to College of American Pathologists/",
            "Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments standards. The CYP2D6 variants and copy number alterations tested for were previously described (Table S1).19 Similar to other clinical assays, duplications were reported, but which allele was duplicated and number of copies could not be detected, leading to ranged phenotypes (e.g., NM-UM) in some cases. Patients with NM-UM phenotype range were treated as UMs to err on the side of caution. Otherwise, genotype information was translated into phenotypes, as described in Table S1. The genotype results and predicted phenotype (based on CYP2D6 activity score per CPIC guidelines at the time of the study)12 were placed in the electronic health record (EHR) in a discrete format at UF Health and via secure email in PDF format, which was uploaded in the research section of the EHR, at Moffitt. Pharmacists considered CYP2D6 results and concomitant CYP2D6 inhibitors, per FDA classification, to assign a clinical phenotype for each patient.23 For patients taking strong inhibitors (e.g., bupropion, fluoxetine), the clinical phenotype (regardless of genotype) was adjusted to a PM, while for moderate (e.g., duloxetine) and weak inhibitors (e.g., sertraline), the activity score was reduced by 50% to derive the clinical phenotype.12 Recommendations were made to avoid codeine, tramadol, hydrocodone, and oxycodone for PMs, IMs, and UMs. Recommendations were provided to the treating physician in the consult note, which was placed in the EHR (UF) or sent via secure email (Moffitt). Generally, morphine or hydromorphone was recommended as an alternative opioid. Prescribing decisions were left to the physician's discretion. Samples collected from patients in the usual care arm were sent to the UF Center for Pharmacogenomics and Precision Medicine for CYP2D6 genotyping at the end of the study for research purposes only (i.e., were not placed in the EHR or shared with physicians for clinical use), using PCR and pyrosequencing as previously described.24,25."

            "The primary outcomes were feasibility of implementing a genotype-guided opioid prescribing approach to manage pain for cancer patients and the change in pain intensity. Feasibility was assessed based on the implementation metrics of percent of patients willing to participate, genotype turnaround time (defined as number of days from sample collection to results being reported by the pathology laboratory), percent of patients with a CYP2D6 phenotype that warranted alternative therapy, and physician acknowledgement of genotype results. For the effectiveness outcome, a composite pain score (scale of 1 to 10) was calculated, which was the average of the patient-reported “worst pain” and “pain on average\" in the last 24 hours and “pain you have right now\" from the BPI-SF.28 Pain",
            "was categorized as mild, (score 1–3), moderate (score of 4-6) or severe (score of 7–10) according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.22 Two composites from the MDASI questionnaire were calculated if more than 50% of the questions were answered: core symptom severity, which was the mean of 13 core symptom items, and symptom distress, which was the mean of 6 interference items. Change in pain and symptom severity scores was calculated as the percent difference from baseline score to the score at last follow up ([baseline - follow-up] / baseline). Patients who only completed baseline and week two surveys were excluded from this analysis since this may not have allowed sufficient time for the physician to receive and act on genotype results. Data were compared between the two arms using x2 analysis or Fishers Exact and the two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum for categorical and continuous data, respectively. Data analyses were conducted using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Carry, NC).",
            "Initial targeted enrollment was 176 patients, which was estimated to provide 80% power with an alpha of 0.05 to detect a one point difference in BPI-SF pain scores between groups.29 However, funding was was discontinued after the first year due to changes in the sponsor's priorities. The number of participants enrolled was thus a convenience sample to evaluate the feasibility and provide preliminary effectiveness data of a CYP2D6-guided approach to pain management."

However, we observed low provider utilization of genotype-guided recommendations.

Accordingly, we summarize lessons learned from clinical implementation and research standpoints through the conduction of this trial (Table 5)."

          "content": [
            "The low rate of prescribing action in the genotype-guided arm reinforces the need to assess barriers of changing medications when appropriate, based on CYP2D6 phenotype. Delays in obtaining PGx results may be a factor. In our study, as in previous trials,15,31 genotype results were available approximately one to two weeks following the patient's clinic visit. In our trial, physicians may have waited until the patient returned to clinic to act on results, which may have been after the participant's follow-up ended. It is also possible that physicians made changes to pain therapy during the enrollment visit and were hesitant to make additional changes just one to two weeks later when genotype results returned. Changes in therapy may also lead to increased out-of-pocket cost for patients if alternative pain medications or formulations result in additional expense or dependent on insurance coverage and prior authorizations, making certain medications financially unattainable for some, particularly vulnerable, patients.32",
            "Another lesson learned was that genotyping from noninvasive sample collection (e.g., buccal cell collection via cytobrushes) may have contributed to the lower than desired genotyping success rate, requiring sample recollection and further delaying results. One solution implemented at UF to overcome this challenge is to collect additional buccal samples in the event the first sample fails to yield sufficient DNA. Of note, since the trial concluded, UF switched to foam brushes for buccal sample collection and has reported excellent genotyping success (>99%).31",
            "Observations from our study may further contribute to the overall knowledgebase on oxycodone response and CYP2D6 clinical phenotype. Specifically, there was no difference in baseline pain score by CYP2D6 clinical phenotype among patients taking oxycodone. Data support a clear and strong CYP2D6 association with response to codeine and tramadol.13 There are also data suggesting that CYP2D6 genotype may effectively guide treatment with hydrocodone.15,31 However, the CYP2D6-oxycodone response relationship is less clear, and recent data suggest that CYP2D6 may not influence clinical response to oxycodone.15 A recent analysis of patients with cancer, most of whom were taking codeine, tramadol, or hydrocodone, found that compared to NMs, PMs or IMs had increased rates of hospitalizations secondary to pain and more often required non-CYP2D6 metabolized",
            "opioids to manage pain.33 Based on this evidence, current clinical recommendations at UF Health Health are to avoid codeine, tramadol, and hydrocodone in PMs and IMs but no recommendations are provided for oxycodone.",
            "During the trial, notes containing genotype-guided recommendations were placed in the 'research section' of the EHR at Moffitt, but PGx testing has since become more integrated into clinical practice. At UF, pharmacist recommendations were placed as consultation notes in the EHR and electronically routed to the oncologist. Of the eleven patients with recommendations to change opioid therapy, two had changes made, with prescribers noting genotype as a consideration in their clinical notes. This trial was the first PGx implementation for supportive care management in patients with cancer both at UF and Moffitt, and oncologists were not acclimated to looking for PGx results to guide opioid therapy, potentially contributing to the low adoption of PGx recommendations.",
            "Early adopters of PGx testing have reported the importance of physician education for successful implementation and outlined five educational strategies: face-to-face (grand rounds presentations); direct-to-provider (email); point-of-care (CDS alerts); resource development (online training); and links to online resources.34 Our study utilized both, face-to-face education at the beginning of the study and direct-to-provider education through clinical notes or email with recommendations. However, automated CDS was not integrated into the EHR at either study site to prompt recommendations at the time of opioid prescribing. Providing recommendations through a clinical note without point-of-care CDS may have been insufficient for ensuring PGx considerations for therapy.35 Since the study concluded, automated alerts have become available at UF Health to relay genotype-guided recommendations. Moffitt now reports CYP2D6 results as discrete data to similarly allow for CDS when prescribing opioids. EHR integration of PGx test results and recommendations support transdisciplinary clinical care since all providers and staff involved in the patient's care can see such notes and test results.36,37",
            "While our study used a reactive approach to genotyping, some institutions are genotyping prospectively for CYP2D6 and other pharmacogenes to inform future therapies.38,39 Indeed, our physician authors reported that not having results and accompanying recommendations at the time of enrollment was a major barrier to implementation. In the oncology setting, matched normal sample (germline) next generation sequencing (NGS) is expanding into routine care, and PGx information obtained from DNA sequencing is likely to become more common. Such information could be useful for pain management and other supportive care therapies, such as ondansetron, voriconazole, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and proton pump inhibitors.40,41,42,43,44,45. Further understanding of clinical implementation barriers is needed to the guide the evolving practice landscape as healthcare moves to proactive genotyping for cancer management."

        "genotyping upon study completion. This suggests that getting clinical PGx results may be a key motivator for participation.15,31",
        "There was low adherence to survey completion suggesting that survey completion was over-burdening to this patient population. Similar issues have been reported in other studies of patient-reported outcomes.20 Strategies limiting the frequency of questionnaires, rather than the number of items included, appear to improve completion rates.20",
        "Another challenge encountered was that each site created their own randomization log, which resulted in an excess of patients randomized to the usual care arm. Permuted block randomization, using a centralized randomization process and one randomization list per site may help ensure balance in the number of patients assigned to each arm.46",
        "A limitation of our study was that data on duration of pain management was not collected. A longer duration of pain therapy may allow more time for trial-and-error, and thus, PGx results may be more valuable if obtained soon after cancer diagnosis. Future studies may benefit from focusing on patients initiating pain management or stratifying patients based on duration of prior pain management. Finally, pragmatic PGx clinical trials investigate the effectiveness of genotype-guided interventions in real-world settings that are inclusive of diverse clinical practices.37 Heterogeneity allows for a practical application to patient care, but analysis of interventions on outcomes such as pain control is challenging due to numerous covariates. This is especially true in oncology, where pain is complex and influenced by factors beyond pharmacotherapy. Clinical trials comparing pain among similar cancer types, disease burden, and treatment regimens, including types and duration of previous opioid therapy, may further elucidate the role of CYP2D6-guided cancer pain management."

There are additional research-related barriers to successful assessment of outcomes with PGx implementation in this setting. Pain management is complex, and genetic factors only partially influence clinical decisions. Future clinical trials that incorporate genotyping into multimodal pain management models may help identify novel approaches that improve patient-reported outcomes, especially for those patients with suboptimal cancer pain control."

Oxycodone (n=58), tramadol (n=5), and hydrocodone (n=3) was used by patients reported in this figure. Median composite pain scores were 5.00 for NM (n=47), 5.00 for IM (n=8), and 6.17 for PM (n=4) and are represented by the lines inside the boxes. The boxes define the 25th to 75th quartiles with the line being the median, and the vertical lines (whiskers) represent the maximum and minimum values. There was one individual who had a range phenotype of “NM to UM,” with a baseline pain composite score of 5.33 (not shown)."
